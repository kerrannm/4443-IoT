PROJECT IDEA: I'd like to make a 3D printed pot that will light up when the plant requires watering.Functional Parts & Fritzing Schematic from https://www.elithecomputerguy.com/2019/07/soil-moisture-sensor-led-alert-with-arduino-uno/: 

| REASONS BEHIND CHOICE:  |
| ------------- |
| #1 Feasibly completed with the time constraints and my poor dexterity |
| #2 Modular and can be expanded upon with more time/skill level/random ideas |
| #3 I can't remember to do small chores like watering plants |
