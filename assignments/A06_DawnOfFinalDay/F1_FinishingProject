With so much time dedicated to 3D printing, finishing the project that I had sought out to complete at the beginning of the semester seemed nearly an afterthought... especially with such little time remaining in the class. Fortunately, I was able to to pull off some basic functionality! 

Due to the size of my finished project (aaand my inability to properly size objects), I ended up using an ESP32 instead of an Arduino -- the latter wouldn't fit inside of my finished project! Blunders became blessings once again, though, as hooking up the components to the ESP32 was a breeze. In terms of code, I was able to mash up two open source code snippets from esp32io.com ( [this](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-soil-moisture-sensor) and [this](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-traffic-light) ) to quickly get something up and running. The only thing that was really left to do was determine the logic for which light would illuminate for each value. Strangely enough, higher values were associated with drier environments, so it seems the sensor's value function in the opposite way than one would intuit. The code for the project can be seen in F2_MoistureLEDS.   

Here's what the pot ended up looking like:



A video of the sensor responding to different levels of moisture can be seen in F3_SensorDemo. I am somewhat satisified with how this came out, but wish I had more time to make a more robust final project. Implementing irrigation or having network connectivity to send a mobile notification on moisture level would have be nifty. I think that I spent too much time fiddling with resistors and accidentally breaking wires and messing up soldering and and and and and... to really do what something I could genuinely say that I'm proud of. This class is the last one I'm taking before graduation and it is honestly a bit of a bummer to end with a fizzle, but I know that I can look forward to personal project work in the future... I'm thinking of getting a bambu!
