As my project involves the toggling of an LED with a sensor, it makes sense to start out with figuiring out how to program an LED to light up (seen in F2_BasicBlink.mp4)  

After that, learning how to incorporate sensor input to toggle LEDs seemed like a good next step. A proximity sensor was used to light up a certain amount of LEDs based on how close something was. This can be seen in the (F3_Prox.mp4) file. Although the sensor used wasn't the same as what is required in the final project, the logic *should* carry over. The code can be seen in the F4_july20sensor.ino file. 

Next steps: Work with actual components for project, get familiar with 3D printer.
