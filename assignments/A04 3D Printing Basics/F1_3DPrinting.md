After learning a little bit about wiring, bread boards, arduinos, and all that other fun stuff... it was time to move on to learning how to use a 
3D printer!  

Before selecting one of the thingiverse/printable files for my actual project, I picked a stress test to see how the printer works. I chose [this spider](https://www.printables.com/model/299185-spiders-web-a-3d-printer-stress-test) as it was super adorable and that was the only criteria that truly mattered. Seriously, look at it!!
